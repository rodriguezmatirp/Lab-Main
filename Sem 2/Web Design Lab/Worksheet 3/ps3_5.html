        Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms <a>of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page</a> long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what <a>constitutes a paragraph.</a>
