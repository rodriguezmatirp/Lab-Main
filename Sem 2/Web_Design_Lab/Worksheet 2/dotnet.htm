    .NET Framework (pronounced as "dot net") is a software framework<br>
        developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. <br>
        It includes a large class library named as Framework Class Library <br>
        (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code<br>
        written in other languages) across several programming languages.
