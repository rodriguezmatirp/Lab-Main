        Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based,<br>
        object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies<br>
        as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, run <br>
        anywhere (WORA),meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms <br>
        that support Java without the need for recompilation.
