# Processes running with UID 0 can be considered 'system-wide' processes


# QN 7
# Can you use grep to see how many of your processes are running?
ps -U $UID
# The -U flag makes ps look for user specific processes with a list of UID which follows the -U flag
ps -el | grep $UID
# This is not same as -U flag as this also matches any line containing the same numbers as the UID


# QN 8
# Observation: you need read permission to list the files of a directory.
# You need write permission to create a file.

# QN 9
# Use a combination of cat (or more) and grep to display information in /etc/passwd about your own details

# What does this line mean?
# It represents the entry for my user account

# Which character is used to separate fields in the file?
# colon :

# How is your password stored?
# In a encrypted form

# If you try and access /etc/shadow what happens?
# Permission denied for normal user
